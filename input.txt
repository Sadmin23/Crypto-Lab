The solution that Kasiski came up with was ingenious. As an example, consider what we get when we encode the plaintext "maths is short for mathematics" using the keyword key we get the ciphertext shown in the table below. The important things to notice are the two bits that are bolded. Due to the repeating nature of the key, both times we see "math", it is encrypted in the same way to "WERR".
